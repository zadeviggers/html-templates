# Zade's HTML templates

These are some useful HTML templates, that come with CSS included. None of them
use any JavaScript.

Some templates come with a JavaScript function to generate the HTML server-side
based on some inputs.

You can use these anywhere for anything, as long as you keep the HTML comment
that credits the template to me.
